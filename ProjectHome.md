SLAM or simultaneous localisation and mapping is an important area of research in robotics.  RatSLAM is a version of SLAM based on the rodent hippocampus using a vision system.  This thesis project aims to implement a version of RatSLAM on a lego NXT using sonar sensors. This would provide an open source version of RatSLAM implemented on a easily accessible robot platform for further experimentation.
